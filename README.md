# Network Programming in C, C++ & Python

A **cross‑language exploration** of network programming, spanning from **low‑level socket APIs** to **high‑level abstractions**. This repository demonstrates how to build **robust, efficient, and portable networked applications** using **C**, **C++**, and **Python**.

---

## Overview
This repo is designed for learners and professionals who want to:
- Understand the **client–server model** across different languages.
- Implement **TCP** and **UDP** communication from scratch.
- Explore **secure protocols** and scalable design patterns.
- Compare **language‑specific approaches** to networking problems.

---

## Tech Stack
| Language | Key Libraries/APIs | Typical Use Cases |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **C**   | BSD Sockets / Winsock | OS tools, embedded systems, protocol implementations |
| **C++** | Boost.Asio, cpprestsdk | Scalable services, async servers, game networking |
| **Python** | `socket`, `asyncio`, `requests` | Prototypes, automation, quick network utilities |

---

## Contents
- **C** → Low‑level socket programming with BSD/Winsock  
- **C++** → OOP abstractions & async network services  
- **Python** → Rapid prototyping, automation scripts, and tools  
- **Examples**: Chat servers, file transfer utilities, port scanners, mailing clients.

---

## Security & Best Practices
- Secure connections with **TLS/SSL**  
- Input validation & error handling  
- Graceful resource cleanup

---

## Goals
- Provide **side‑by‑side implementations** for C, C++, and Python.
- Highlight **trade‑offs** between performance, complexity, and development speed.
- Serve as a **hands‑on reference** for distributed systems, IoT, and cloud integration.
